this entire account's purpose is to let my friend list know a part that isn't the host is fronting.

**i am a person with did. don't refer to me as a system it makes me uncomfortable.** alternatives to calling me a system include a person with did or just a person.

don't interact:
* endos and people who believe they exist
* people who treat introjected parts as actual fictional characters ([please learn what introjection in did actually is lol](https://medcraveonline.com/JPCPY/introjection-and-dissociative-identity-disorder-a-case-report.html))
* "i wish i was a system" people

before interacting
* some of my parts are edgy-in-nature and make dark jokes. they'll stop upon request just tell them ok?
* i won't respond at all my parts prefer to stick to friends only ok?
